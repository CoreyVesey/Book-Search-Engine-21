  ## Description

  I am having difficulty loading the client side on to the page. When i run npm run start it loads the link to the localhost but then showed an error in the console log of
   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <..... I read this https://idiallo.com/javascript/uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token#n and tried to comment out the html file in the build file, that caused the console log error message to stop but a blank screen just appears now. So I just refactored as best I could.
